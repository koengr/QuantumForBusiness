### I want to learn the technical details

![Shape1](RackMultipart20240520-1-nfb940_html_685e0b4ca47066cc.gif)

For (late) high school students:

(or those who followed high-school level mathematics):

- [**Quantum Quest**](http://new.quantum-quest.nl/) [EN] (intensive 5-week online course about  **theory ** of quantum computing. Materials freely available for self-study).
- [**Quantum Rules**](http://new.quantumrules.nl/)[NL] (1-day  **lab experiments**  dealing with quantum physics)
- [**Masterclass Quantum**](https://www.betapartners.nl/masterclass-quantum2022/) [NL] (3-day extracurricular course about the theory of quantum computing and particle physics)

Undergraduate (Bachelor's) university level:

- [**Quantum.Country**](https://quantum.country/qcvc) [Website] – the "Duolingo of Quantum Computing", a very well-written introduction for those with late high-school or early university level math background.
- [**Quantum Computation and Quantum Information**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Computation_and_Quantum_Information) (Nielsen, Chuang) [Book] – the "bible of quantum computing". Perhaps not the most up-to-date, but definitely the most well-known resource in our field. Sets the standards for jargon and notation.

- [**Quantum Computer Science: An Introduction**](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/quantum-computer-science/66462590D10C8010017CF1D7C45708D7) (Mermin) [Book] – a well-written introduction, with quite some focus on manipulating quantum circuits.
- [**Quantum Computing Since Democritus**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Computing_Since_Democritus) (Aaronson) [Book] – Aaronson is an authority in the field. His book touched upon many topics such as the foundations of computer science, black holes and consciousness, making it a good read for those looking for something much more broad than just quantum computing.

Graduate (Master's) level:

These assume no prior knowledge, but require a strong background in mathematics (i.e. Linear Algebra, Calculus, advanced inequality bounds and approximations, etc.). In exchange, they go into much more detail.

- [**Lecture Notes for UvA course "Quantum Computing" by Ronald de Wolf**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.09415) **,**  which is frequently updated and features some cutting-edge algorithms. Via the [course website](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~rdewolf/qc22.html), you can find the link and password to view all the recorded lectures too.

- [**Lecture Notes for Caltech course "Quantum Computing" by John Preskil **](http://theory.caltech.edu/~preskill/ph229/)

For research projects, internships or theses:

- [Internships offered at Centrum Wiskunde en Informatica](https://www.cwi.nl/jobs/traineeships/current-master-projects)
- Quantum Delta NL hosts a [job board](https://jobs.quantumdelta.nl/jobs).
- Students of University of Amsterdam can find quantum projects on [Datanose](https://datanose.nl/).

Scientific papers

Introductions mostly aimed at (non-quantum) scientists. All papers we mention are open-access and peer-reviewed, which guarantees a correct and balanced presentation (and makes them suitable for you to cite).

- [**Quantum algorithms: an overview**](https://www.nature.com/articles/npjqi201523) (Ashley Montanaro)
- [**The Potential Impact of Quantum Computers on Society**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05380) (Ronald de Wolf) [[**video lecture**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ych-yB9QP_A)]

Scientific opinions and discussions

- [**Scott Aaronson's blog**](https://scottaaronson.com/blog) **. ** Although written from a theoretical computer science perspective, this blog addresses a very broad range of quantum computing topics. Prof. Aaronson has a strong authority in the field, and his posts attract readership and comments from a broad range of prominent scientists.

Scientific news

None of these focus exclusively on Quantum Technology, but all offer high-quality news (and surely none would miss any important quantum breakthroughs).

- [**Quanta Magazine**](https://www.quantamagazine.org/)
- [**Phys.org**](https://phys.org/)
- [**Quantum Universe**](https://new.quantumuniverse.nl/) [NL]

### I want to learn to program a quantum computer

There are several programming packages for quantum computers, mostly maintained by major hardware providers. Nearly all of these offer great introductory tutorials that guide your through both the basics of Quantum Computing and the usage of the package.

The ones we recommend below are all in Python:

- [**Qiskit**](https://learn.qiskit.org/course/introduction/why-quantum-computing) **: Introduction to Quantum Computing **(by IBM)
- [**Cirq tutorials **](https://quantumai.google/cirq/start)(by Google)
- [**QWorld Bronze **](https://qworld.net/workshop-bronze/)offers various online training programs around the world, mostly focused on Qiskit and sometimes ProjectQ.

### I want to learn more about business opportunities

Business News Websites

- [**The Quantum Observer**](https://quantumobserver.eu/)– newly formed news collection platform, allowing upvotes and comments to news articles.

- [**Quantum Computing Report**](https://quantumcomputingreport.com/news/) **– ** don't be fooled by the basic look on the website. The content is written with a very critical eye and with very relevant contextual information.

- [**The Quantum Insider**](https://thequantuminsider.com/)

Overview articles about business opportunities (close to this blog)

Of course, we first recommend that you start reading our [Professional's Guide to Quantum Computing](https://new.quantum.amsterdam/preface-a-professionals-guide-to-quantum-technology/)!

Many others have written similar guides. Most of these come from consultants of hardware providers who have a financial interest in making others get started with quantum. In our opinion, the articles are sometimes too optimistic and predict that quantum applications will come much sooner than the typical expert would anticipate. On the other hand, they collect insightful details about financial matters.

Workshops

- [**The Workshop General Awareness Quantum Computing **](https://new.quantum.amsterdam/education/education-workshops/)is an introduction to business opportunties that requires no deep mathemtical background, but gives an essential overview to how quantum computers will impact businesses and governments.
